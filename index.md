On this website I will try to guide you through the interactive part of the practical DFT lecture. Hopefully this will be interesting and useful for you!

We will be using the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) in conjunction with the DFT code [GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/index.html).

## Google Colab ##
Both ASE and GPAW operate through Python. We will be using Google's Colab service to make it easy to follow along. No need to install Python 
locally. Our code will be running in a Jupyter notebook on a Google server.
To access a Python notebook just follow one of the links and then click on 'File' > 'Save a copy in Drive...'

Google Colab: Copying a Python notebook to your Google Drive

Once you have copied the notebook to your Google Drive you can edit, execute and work on it.
